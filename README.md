# Promptly

## Description

Promptly is a project designed to manage and utilize a curated collection of prompts, primarily intended for interacting with AI models. The prompts are stored in JSON format and are categorized for easy browsing and use.

## Features

*   An extensive collection of prompts stored locally
*   Prompts are categorized (e.g., Productivity, Marketing, Coding, Creativity) and include details like title, language, and expected output type.
*   Prompts use placeholders (`{{variable}}`) for easy customization.
*   A web interface ([index.html](index.html)) for interacting with the prompts.
*   A potential backend server ([server.js](server.js)) using Node.js.
*   An interface ([updatePrompts.html](updatePrompts.html)) possibly for updating prompts.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - Required to run the server and manage dependencies.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Promptly
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```
    *(Note: Check [package.json](package.json) for specific start scripts like `npm start` if `node server.js` doesn't work).*

## Usage

*   Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (The port number is usually specified in `server.js` or the terminal output, often 3000 or 8080).
*   Use the web interface to browse, search, and utilize the prompts.
